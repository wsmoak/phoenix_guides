### What we'll need

The only thing we'll need for this guide is a working Phoenix application. For those of us who need a simple application to deploy, please follow the [Up and Running guide](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/up-and-running).

### Goals

Our main goal for this guide is to get a Phoenix application running on Heroku.

## Steps

Let's separate this process into a few steps so we can keep track of where we are.

- Initialize Git repository
- Sign up for Heroku
- Install the Heroku Toolbelt
- Create the Heroku application
- Add the Phoenix static buildpack
- Make our project Heroku-ready
- Deploy time!
- Useful Heroku commands

## Initializing Git repository

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a popular decentralized revision control system and is also used to deploy apps to Heroku.

Before we can push to Heroku we'll need to initialize a local Git repository and commit our files to it. We can do so by running the following commands in our project directory:

```console
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Heroku offers some great information on how it is using Git [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#tracking-your-app-in-git).

## Signing up for Heroku

Signing up to Heroku is very simple, just head over to [https://signup.heroku.com/](https://signup.heroku.com/) and fill in the form.

The Free plan will give us one web [dyno](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#dynos) and one worker dyno, as well as a PostgreSQL and Redis instance for free.

These are meant to be used for testing and development, and come with some limitations. In order to run a production application, please consider upgrading to a paid plan.

## Installing the Heroku Toolbelt

Once we have signed up, we can download the correct version of the Heroku Toolbelt for our system [here](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).

The Heroku CLI, part of the Toolbelt, is useful to create Heroku applications, list currently running dynos for an existing application, tail logs or run one-off commands (mix tasks for instance).

## Creating the Heroku Application

Now that we have the Toolbelt installed, let's create the Heroku application. In our project directory, run:

> Note: the first time we use a Heroku command, it may prompt us to log in. If this happens, just enter the email and password you specified during signup.

```console
$ heroku create --buildpack "https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir.git"
Creating mysterious-meadow-6277... done, stack is cedar-14
Buildpack set. Next release on mysterious-meadow-6277 will use https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir.git.
https://mysterious-meadow-6277.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/mysterious-meadow-6277.git
Git remote heroku added
```

> Note: the name of the Heroku application is the random string after "Creating" in the output above (mysterious-meadow-6277). This will be unique, so expect to see a different name from "mysterious-meadow-6277".

The `--buildpack` option we are passing allows us to specify the [Elixir buildpack](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir) we want Heroku to use.
A [buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) is a convenient way of packaging framework and/or runtime support. In our case it's installing Erlang, Elixir, fetching our application dependencies, and so on, before we run it.

The URL in the output is the URL to our application. If we open it in our browser now, we will get the default Heroku welcome page.

> Note: if we hadn't initialized our Git repository before we ran the `heroku create` command, we wouldn't have our Heroku remote repository properly set up at this point. We can set that up manually by running: `heroku git:remote -a [our-app-name].`

## Adding the Phoenix Static Buildpack

We need to compile static assets for a successful Phoenix deployment. The [Phoenix static buildpack](https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static) can take care of that for us, so let's add it now.

```console
$ heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static.git
Buildpack added. Next release on mysterious-meadow-6277 will use:
  1. https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir.git
  2. https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static.git
Run `git push heroku master` to create a new release using these buildpacks.
```

## Making our Project Heroku-ready

Every new Phoenix project ships with a config file `config/prod.secret.exs` which stores configuration that should not be committed along with our source code. By default Phoenix adds it to our `.gitignore` file.

This works great except Heroku uses [environment variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) to pass sensitive informations to our application. It means we need to make some changes to our config before we can deploy.

First, let's make sure our secret key is loaded from Heroku's environment variables instead of `config/prod.secret.exs` by adding a `secret_key_base` line  in `config/prod.exs`:

```elixir
config :hello_phoenix, HelloPhoenix.Endpoint,
  http: [port: {:system, "PORT"}],
  url: [host: "example.com", port: 80],
  cache_static_manifest: "priv/static/manifest.json",
  secret_key_base: System.get_env("SECRET_KEY_BASE")
```

Then, we'll add the production database configuration to `config/prod.exs`:

```elixir
# Configure your database
config :hello_phoenix, HelloPhoenix.Repo,
  adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres,
  url: System.get_env("DATABASE_URL"),
  pool_size: String.to_integer(System.get_env("POOL_SIZE") || "10"),
  ssl: true
```

Now, let's tell Phoenix to use our Heroku URL and enforce we only use the SSL version of the website. Find the url line:

```elixir
url: [host: "example.com", port: 80],
```

... and replace it with this (don't forget to replace `mysterious-meadow-6277` with your application name):

```elixir
url: [scheme: "https", host: "mysterious-meadow-6277.herokuapp.com", port: 443],
force_ssl: [rewrite_on: [:x_forwarded_proto]],
```

Since our configuration is now handled using Heroku's environment variables, we don't need to import the `config/prod.secret.exs` file in `/config/prod.exs` any longer, so we can delete the following line:

```elixir
import_config "prod.secret.exs"
```

Our `config/prod.exs` now looks like this:

```elixir
use Mix.Config

...

config :hello_phoenix, HelloPhoenix.Endpoint,
  http: [port: {:system, "PORT"}],
  url: [scheme: "https", host: "mysterious-meadow-6277.herokuapp.com", port: 443],
  force_ssl: [rewrite_on: [:x_forwarded_proto]],
  cache_static_manifest: "priv/static/manifest.json",
  secret_key_base: System.get_env("SECRET_KEY_BASE")

# Do not print debug messages in production
config :logger, level: :info

# Configure your database
config :hello_phoenix, HelloPhoenix.Repo,
  adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres,
  url: System.get_env("DATABASE_URL"),
  pool_size: String.to_integer(System.get_env("POOL_SIZE") || "10"),
  ssl: true
```

Finally, we need to decrease the timeout for the websocket transport in `web/channels/user_socket.ex`:

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.UserSocket do
  use Phoenix.Socket

  ...

  ## Transports
  transport :websocket, Phoenix.Transports.WebSocket,
    timeout: 45_000
end
```

This ensures that any idle connections are closed by Phoenix before they reach Heroku's 55 second timeout window.

Lastly, we'll need to create a [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) with the following:

```
web: MIX_ENV=prod mix phoenix.server

```

## Creating Environment Variables in Heroku

The `DATABASE_URL` config var is automatically created by Heroku when we add the [Heroku Postgres add-on](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql). We can create the database via the heroku toolbelt:

```console
$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```

Now we set the `POOL_SIZE` config var:

```console
$ heroku config:set POOL_SIZE=18
```

This value should be just under the number of available connections, leaving a couple open for migrations and mix tasks. The hobby-dev database allows 20 connections, so we set this number to 18. If additional dynos will share the database, reduce the `POOL_SIZE` to give each dyno an equal share.

When running a mix task you will also want to limit its pool size like so:

```console
$ heroku run "POOL_SIZE=2 mix hello_phoenix.task"
```

So that Ecto does not attempt to open more than the available connections.

We still have to create the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` config based on a random string. First, use `mix phoenix.gen.secret` to get a new secret:

```console
$ mix phoenix.gen.secret
xvafzY4y01jYuzLm3ecJqo008dVnU3CN4f+MamNd1Zue4pXvfvUjbiXT8akaIF53
```

Your random string will be different; don't use this example value.

Now set it in Heroku:

```console
$ heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE="xvafzY4y01jYuzLm3ecJqo008dVnU3CN4f+MamNd1Zue4pXvfvUjbiXT8akaIF53"
Setting config vars and restarting mysterious-meadow-6277... done, v3
SECRET_KEY_BASE: xvafzY4y01jYuzLm3ecJqo008dVnU3CN4f+MamNd1Zue4pXvfvUjbiXT8akaIF53
```

If you need to make any of your config variables available at compile time, you will need to explicitly define which ones in a configuration file. Create a file `elixir_buildpack.config` in your application's root directory and add a line like: `config_vars_to_export=(MY_VAR)`. See [here](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir#specifying-config-vars-to-export-at-compile-time) for more information.

## Deploy Time!

Our project is now ready to be deployed on Heroku.

Let's commit all our changes:

```
$ git add config/prod.exs
$ git add Procfile
$ git add web/channels/user_socket.ex
$ git commit -m "Use production config from Heroku ENV variables and decrease socket timeout"
```

And deploy:

```console

Typing `heroku open` in the terminal should launch a browser with the Phoenix welcome page opened. In case you are using Ecto to access a database, you will also need to run migrations after the first deploy:

```console
$ heroku run "POOL_SIZE=2 mix ecto.migrate"
```

And that's it!

## Useful Heroku Commands

We can look at the logs of our application by running the following command in our project directory:

```console
$ heroku logs # use --tail if you want to tail them
```

We can also start an IEx session attached to our terminal for experimenting in our app's environment:

```console
$ heroku run "POOL_SIZE=2 iex -S mix"
```

In fact, we can run anything using the `heroku run` command, like the Ecto migration task from above:

```console
$ heroku run "POOL_SIZE=2 mix ecto.migrate"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Compilation Error

Occasionally, an application will compile locally, but not on Heroku. The compilation error on Heroku will look something like this:

```console
remote: == Compilation error on file lib/postgrex/connection.ex ==
remote: could not compile dependency :postgrex, "mix compile" failed. You can recompile this dependency with "mix deps.compile postgrex", update it with "mix deps.update postgrex" or clean it with "mix deps.clean postgrex"
remote: ** (CompileError) lib/postgrex/connection.ex:207: Postgrex.Connection.__struct__/0 is undefined, cannot expand struct Postgrex.Connection
remote:     (elixir) src/elixir_map.erl:58: :elixir_map.translate_struct/4
remote:     (stdlib) lists.erl:1353: :lists.mapfoldl/3
remote:     (stdlib) lists.erl:1354: :lists.mapfoldl/3
remote:
remote:
remote:  !     Push rejected, failed to compile elixir app
remote:
remote: Verifying deploy...
remote:
remote: !   Push rejected to mysterious-meadow-6277.
remote:
To https://git.heroku.com/mysterious-meadow-6277.git
```

This has to do with stale dependencies which are not getting recompiled properly. It's possible to force Heroku to recompile all dependencies on each deploy, which should fix this problem. The way to do it is to add a new file called `elixir_buildpack.config` at the root of the application. The file should contain this line:

```
always_rebuild=true
```

Commit this file to the repository and try to push again to Heroku.
